            <p>“What am I most proud of...My wife and my kids and my dogs..of course. They have shown me the importance of being the best person you can be at all 
                levels. Nothing is impossible. Being the example above all things. The physical things I have done are great and have helped me grow but are not the
                meaning of life. There is a spiritual standard we must make ourselves adhere to. That is where we need to grow. Being more kind, more compassionate, 
                more tolerant. At the end you will know you have lived a Good life. “ – Mike England

            <h2>Dragons Heart Kennels</h2>
             <img src="images/DragonsHeartSign.jpg" alt="Dragons Heart Kennel Sign" class="contentImg">
            <p>Mike is very mechanical savvy and was the Maintenance Lead at a large plant that engineers wood products. This was a good job but was very stressful
                and was not what Mike was passionate about. He was passionate about working with animals, particularly dogs. He has four huskies of his own. This last 
                year, Mike took a risk and opened his own dog kenneling business. He built his facility with his own hands. The building has an excellent heating and 
                cooling system to keep the dogs comfortable. Temperature monitors and cameras on the living facilities to make sure that the dogs are safe. He has gained 
                some inspiration and knowledge from Cesar Millan, the dog whisper. Including how dogs think in the pack mentality. Mike makes sure to get the dogs plenty of 
                outside time to play in the large fenced in yard. He also has built and setup obstacles to help train the dogs. He makes exercise fun for the dogs. The dogs are
                living well when they stay with Mike at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dhkllc/" target="_blank" id="DHKLink">Dragons Heart Kennel.</a> His kennel has only received 
                five-star reviews and his clients has been more than pleased with his service and how their pets are treated. After taking a risk and following his dream, Mike is 
                now the owner of a growing and business that he truly enjoys running.

            <p>“It was only years after Dragon passed away a Shephard/Husky mix that I truly realized his value and heart. Near the end of his life I was at the lowest point in 
                mine. When family and friends basically wrote me off and no one was there to help or even care, he was there. I one thing that would give everything of himself f
                or me and love me truly unconditionally. He was by my side always. My only regret is I didn't realize his heart sooner. I think of him every day and hope what I
                have done he can see from where he is. Dogs are just the best of everything. They are pure and uncorrupted. Their species has been far more tolerant of our species 
                that our species of theirs, yet they give us all of themselves.  I will spend the rest of my days giving back. I won't get rich, I will have to work harder than I had 
                to before but at the end of the day, I love what I do and I feel there is value in this work. It is a value of compassion and love. Something the world could use a lot more of. “- Mike England
